Introduction

This webpage is a mock duplicate of the screenshot provided by We Are Just, Incorporating some additional features as well as functionality.

Approach

My primary focus was to do the replication of the webpage to look as similar as to the screenshot provided. Once I had achieved that I begin moving onto other tasks such as responsiveness and functionality. Throughout the development of the project I kept Clean and well-structured pactices in mind when applying my code.

Challenges

I faced a few challenges, beginning with the responsiveness of the website, as well as applying the body background textures(half spheres), I wanted to apply a tile flip function to display the AJAX dummy data but unfortunately was not successful.
